              Narasimha (Sanskrit: नरसिंह IAST: Narasiṃha, lit. man-lion) is a fierce avatar of the<br>
              Hindu god Vishnu, one who incarnates in the form of part lion and part man to destroy <br>
              evil and end religious persecution and calamity on Earth, thereby restoring Dharma. <br>
              Narasimha iconography shows him with a human torso and lower body, with a lion face  <br>
              and claws, typically with a demon Hiranyakashipu in his lap whom he is in the process <br>
              of killing. The demon is powerful brother of evil Hiranyaksha who had been previously <br>
              killed by Vishnu, who hated Vishnu for killing his brother. Hiranyakashipu gains special <br>
              powers by which he could not be killed during the day or night, inside or outside, by any weapon,  <br>
              and by man or animal. Endowed with new powers, Hiranyakashipu creates chaos, persecutes all <br>
              devotees of Vishnu including his own son.Vishnu understands the demon's power, then creatively <br>
              adapts into a mixed avatar that is neither man nor animal and kills the demon at the junction of <br>
              day and night, inside and outside.[1] Narasimha is known primarily as the 'Great Protector' <br>
              who specifically defends and protects his devotees from evil. The most popular Narasimha mythology <br>
              is the legend that protects his devotee Prahlada, and creatively destroys Prahlada's demonic <br>
              father and tyrant Hiranyakashipu.

              Rama or Ram (/ˈrɑːmə/; Sanskrit: राम, IAST: Rāma // (About this soundlisten)), also known as Ramachandra, <br>
              is a major deity of Hinduism. He is the seventh avatar of the god Vishnu, one of his most popular <br>
              incarnations along with Krishna, Parshurama, and Gautama Buddha. Jain Texts also mentioned Rama as <br>
              eighth balabhadra among the 63 salakapurusas.  In Rama-centric traditions of Hinduism, <br>
              he is considered the Supreme Being.Rama was born to Kaushalya and Dasharatha in Ayodhya, <br>
              the ruler of the Kingdom of Kosala. His siblings included Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna. <br>
               He married Sita. Though born in a royal family, their life is described in the Hindu texts as one <br>
               challenged by unexpected changes such as an exile into impoverished and difficult circumstances, <br>
               ethical questions and moral dilemmas. Of all their travails, the most notable is the kidnapping <br>
               of Sita by demon-king Ravana, followed by the determined and epic efforts of Rama and Lakshmana to <br>
               gain her freedom and destroy the evil Ravana against great odds. The entire life story of Rama, Sita <br>
               and their companions allegorically discusses duties, rights and social responsibilities of an individual. <br>
               It illustrates dharma and dharmic living through model characters.<br>

              Krishna (/ˈkrɪʃnə/, Sanskrit pronunciation: [ˈkɽɪʂɳɐ]; Sanskrit: कृष्ण, IAST: Kṛṣṇa) is a major deity in Hinduism. <br>
               He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu and also as the supreme God in his own right. <br>
                He is the god of compassion, tenderness, love and is one of the most popular and widely revered <br>
                among Indian divinities.[11] Krishna's birthday is celebrated every year by Hindus on Krishna Janmashtami <br>
                according to the lunisolar Hindu calendar, which falls in late August or early September of the Gregorian <br>
                calendar. Krishna is usually depicted with a flute in his hand. <br>

                The anecdotes and narratives of Krishna's life are generally titled as Krishna Leela. <br>
                He is a central character in the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata Purana and the Bhagavad Gita, and is mentioned <br>
                 in many Hindu philosophical, theological, and mythological texts. They portray him in various perspectives: <br>
                  a god-child, a prankster, a model lover, a divine hero, and as the universal supreme being. His iconography reflects   <br>
                these legends, and shows him in different stages of his life, such as an infant eating butter, a young boy playing <br>
                a flute, a young boy with his lover Radha or surrounded by women devotees, or a friendly charioteer giving counsel <br>
                to Arjuna. <br>
